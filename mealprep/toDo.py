# change recipe_storage to store recipes as serving size for 2 people

#FUTURE FEATURE:
# convert the two amounts to be in the same measurement
# add amounts together
# convert to largest conversion available in whole numbers

# change output location (new folder for recipes, upload to drive/evernote, emails
# file to you?)

#site priorities:
# 1) save as or email grocery list and meal plan
#        one button labeled save as
#            adds info to text file and allows you to save it
#        one button labeled email
#            creates email with info in body of text
# 2) add option to edit ingredient info before adding to db
    # options:
        # clean current table and add recipes first?
        # create edit.html and allow user to pick any recipe and edit the information for it
            # then delete that entry and re-add it? or modify it in place
        # add step before adding to db that allows user to modify information
        # that will be inserted into db
# 3) reformat, clean up code, should there be more than 1 blueprint? (one for add?)
# 4) clean up html/css and make it look better
# 5) TEST

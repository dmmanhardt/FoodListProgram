# change recipe_storage to store recipes as serving size for 2 people

#FUTURE FEATURE:
# convert the two amounts to be in the same measurement
# add amounts together
# convert to largest conversion available in whole numbers

# get rid of space in measurement if no measurement provided
# add : after ingredient measurement
# ex sweet potatoes: 2

# change how file name is saved (so it doesn't override file with same name)

# change output location (new folder for recipes, upload to drive/evernote, emails
# file to you?)

# change rounding of final dataframe

# add final recipe list to grocery list for reference

# Build browser based UI

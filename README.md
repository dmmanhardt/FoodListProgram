# **Food-Prep-Helper**

Outputs an organized grocery shopping list, displaying the necessary ingredients for the recipes that the user chooses to make. 

## **Working Functionality**:
1. To add a recipe to the database, enter the name, meal served, and approximate amount of meals it lasts for two people, then paste 
the ingredient information into the text box. The relevant ingredient information will be parsed from that and added to the database.
1. To edit a recipe, select it and then change any of the information within the text boxes.
1. To create a grocery shopping list, enter the day you want to start on, and how many days to plan for. You will then have the option to 
choose a recipe for each meal for each day specified. The recipe will then be displayed, along with a table showing which recipes were 
picked for each meal. This can then be saved to the location the program is installed in.

## **Future Plans**:
1. Add an option to change where the grocery shopping list is saved.
1. Add an option to email the grocery shopping list.
1. Cleaning up HTML templates
1. Switching front-end to be JavaScript/React based.
1. Finish unit testing with pytest

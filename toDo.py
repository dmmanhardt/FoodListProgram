# once recipes for each meal/day are selected, grab the ingredients from the recipe_list
# and add them to a text file (?)

# next step:
# use final dataframe with recipes selected and put together ingredient list

# change recipe_storage to store recipes as serving size for 2 people

# after finding correct recipe info for a recipe, add info to a list (or df?)
# for each recipe, check to see if ingredient name is already there, then add
# to the amount if already there and same measurements

# take lists and output as df shown below

# get rid of lists and just work in dataframe?

# can add amounts if the measurements are different, have recipe_name and
# recipe_measurement at index, before returning final_df, sort list alphabetically
# so that the ingredients with different measurements are grouped together

# create df for grocery list
# Ingredient    Amount    Measurement
